Hi, here's your problem today.

A look-and-say sequence is defined as the integer sequence beginning with a single digit in which the next term is obtained by describing the previous term. An example is easier to understand:

Each consecutive value describes the prior value.

1      #
11     # one 1's
21     # two 1's
1211   # one 2, and one 1.
111221 # #one 1, one 2, and two 1's.

Your task is, return the nth term of this sequence.

def findNthSequence(n):
  # Fill this in.

print(findNthSequence(4))
# 111221
