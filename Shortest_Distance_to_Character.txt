Hi, here's your problem today.

Given a string s and a character c, find the distance for all characters in the string to the character c in the string s. You can assume that the character c will appear at least once in the string.

Here's an example and some starter code:

def shortest_dist(s, c):
  # Fill this in.

print(shortest_dist('helloworld', 'l'))
# [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]
