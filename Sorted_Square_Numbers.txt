Hi, here's your problem today.

Given a list of sorted numbers (can be both negative or positive), return the list of numbers squared in sorted order.

Here's an example and some starting code:

def square_numbers(nums):
 # Fill this in.

print(square_numbers([-5, -3, -1, 0, 1, 4, 5]))
# [0, 1, 1, 9, 16, 25, 25]

Solve this problem in O(n) time.
