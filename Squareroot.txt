Hi, here's your problem today.

Given a positive integer, find the square root of the integer without using any built in square root or power functions (math.sqrt or the ** operator). Give accuracy up to 3 decimal points.

Here's an example and some starter code:

def sqrt(x):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(sqrt(5))
# 2.236
